I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes 
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the Champions my Friends
we keep on fighting till the end
we Are the Champions 
We are the Champions

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
